# Object Detection using YOLO

This project utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once), a real-time object detection system, to identify and locate objects in images or videos. YOLO is known for its efficiency and speed, making it suitable for various applications.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-detection-yolo.git](https://github.com/Sanjanaashivanand/ObjectDetectionUsingYOLO.git
   cd object-detection-yolo
   ```

2. **Download YOLO Weights:**
   Download the pre-trained YOLO weights (YOLOv3 or YOLOv4) from the official YOLO website and place them in the `data/` directory.

   Note: You can find the weights file here : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yT2-zmNFymMgY42Z72LIuqMaiWvYEUQR/view


### Customization

Feel free to customize the parameters in the detection scripts according to your requirements.
